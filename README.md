# MicroProcessor
This project is a 4-bit ALU simulator created for an Embedded Systems course. It models a microprocessor with an ALU, button matrix, LEDs, and an LCD. Written in assembly language using MPLAB, it performs operations like subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and bit counting based on opcodes.
